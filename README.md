# Type Mismatch Bug in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in TypeScript. The `greeter` function expects a single string as input, but an array of strings is passed to it, resulting in a type error.

The solution involves checking the type of the input or modifying the function to handle arrays of strings appropriately.
